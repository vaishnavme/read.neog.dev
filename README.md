 ### Instructions for collaboration

- Don't work on main branch. Create your own branch when working on a feature or bug. We will merge your branch into main when everything checks out.

- Put your css styles of pages in their own respective folders inside style. (example: when working on books page, put all css related to it in styles/books/your.css)
